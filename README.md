## Algorithms and Methods

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target).

**Equation:**
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted value.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the coefficients for each input feature.
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the input features.

### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. It uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

**Equation:**
\[ P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)}} \]

Where:
- \( P(y=1|x) \) is the probability that the output is 1 given the input features.
- \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the parameters to be estimated.
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the input features.

### 3. K-Means Clustering

K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering. It partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on the similarity of the data points.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize K centroids randomly.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of the assigned points.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.

### 4. Decision Trees

Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

**Components:**
- **Root Node:** The top node representing the entire dataset.
- **Internal Nodes:** Represent tests on an attribute.
- **Leaf Nodes:** Represent class labels or output values.

**Splitting Criteria:**
- **Gini Index**
- **Entropy (Information Gain)**
- **Variance Reduction** (for regression)

### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Support Vectors:** Data points closest to the hyperplane.
- **Margin:** Distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors.
- **Kernel Trick:** Transforms the input space into a higher-dimensional space to make it easier to separate the data linearly.

### 6. Neural Networks

Neural networks are a set of algorithms inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).

**Components:**
- **Input Layer:** Takes the input features.
- **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers that transform the input into a form that the output layer can use.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction.

**Common Types:**
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**

### 7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is an unsupervised method used for dimensionality reduction. It transforms the data into a new coordinate system, reducing the number of dimensions while retaining most of the variance in the data.

**Steps:**
1. Standardize the data.
2. Calculate the covariance matrix.
3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4. Sort the eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues.
5. Select the top K eigenvectors to form a new feature space.

## Getting Started

To get started with the materials, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Prawinkumarjs/ML_Master_Class.git
    cd ML_Master_Class
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The command `pip install -r requirements.txt` is used to install the Python packages listed in a file named `requirements.txt`. Here is a breakdown of what this command does:

    - **pip**: This is the package installer for Python. You use it to install and manage packages (libraries or modules) that you want to include in your Python projects.
    - **install**: This is the command to tell `pip` to install packages.
    - **-r requirements.txt**: This tells `pip` to install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The `-r` option stands for "requirement file". The `requirements.txt` file typically contains a list of packages, each on a new line, with optional version numbers. For example:
      ```plaintext
      numpy==1.21.0
      pandas==1.3.0
      scikit-learn==0.24.2
      ```

    ### Example `requirements.txt` File

    Here is an example of what a `requirements.txt` file might look like:

    ```
    numpy==1.21.0
    pandas==1.3.0
    scikit-learn==0.24.2
    matplotlib==3.4.2
    ```

    ### How to Use It

    1. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: List all the packages your project needs in this file. You can manually create it or generate it from an existing environment using the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

    2. **Run the `pip install` command**: Navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
       ```sh
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

    This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the packages listed in it, ensuring that your environment has all the necessary dependencies for your project.

3. **Explore the notebooks**:
    Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to start learning and experimenting with the code.
